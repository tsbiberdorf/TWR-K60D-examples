TWR-K60D bare-metal example of freeRTOS running ADC, SWI and SPI peripheral handling

This project is an example of bare-metal peripheral interfaces while running freeRTOS.

This starting point is basic PDB timer triggering a ADC sample with added SWI interrupt handling.
I then added the TWR-MEM board to my tower system and added SPI communication to the FLASH part.
